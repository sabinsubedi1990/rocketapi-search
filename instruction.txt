Install node.js application on a computer

I have done the following to create the react application

Create React App: create new application
- npx create-react-app rocketapi-search
- cd rocketapi-search

Install axios: for api creation
- npm install axios

Start the application
- npm start 

The app will open on http://localhost:3000

Project structure is as below:

rocketapi-search
-- node_modules: includes the downloaded dependencies added on package.json 
-- public
-- src
--- App.css : css of the application
--- App.js: : added functionality of the search.
--- App.test.js: unit tests can be added here
--- index.css: css of the index page
--- index.js: calls the App.js component
--- logo.svg 
- pacakge.json: dependencies, configuration, scripts are added here

Funtionality added on input:
- handleChange: it will get the vaue entered in the input box and apply the validation according to the requirement 
    and then set the search term useState 
- handlePaste: it will prevent the paste event
- handleSearch: it will validte the searchTerm and send the request to url using axiom with required 
    headers parameter(token-key, host, content-type) and get a response and set the response to setUser useState
    and show it on the card container.
    If there is any error it will catch the error ans setError to useState and display in the the card container


Issue/Note: 
    There is an issue loading the profile pic image. for this we need to create a small backend that fetches the iamges and 
    on the frontend we woudl fetch the image bypassing the CORS limitations.
